<p style="text-indent: 5em;"> It was 3407, we finally took off from Earth. Only a few animal species from earth were remaining, there were 70 crewmates, a huge inventory of seeds and the animals that we could take. On the way to the other planet named “Earth” we saw a lot of places and other planets that we could visit later.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 5em;">``''Earth” there we are, the planet was the beautifulest place to live, 70% of the atmosphere was oxygen,the air was so cold that making artificial fire was impossible, low gravity and water for all sides. The unic land that we could see was islands scattered for all sides, some were big some were small. It was almost night time, and no animal lives were seen. Until 3:47 am, a huge insect was flying, making more noises than a helicopter. With luck we survived the “attack”, the bug didn't even mind us. It was day time, all that we could do was explore the planet. At 4 PM, we landed on a ginormous island. We saw a lot of eggs that were the size of a commercial plane. Until we started to hear a noise, something was crawling to our direction. We saw the biggest snake in all the universe, we never saw a life form bigger than that.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 5em;">he idea was simple: stay one more night on the planet and get OUT. During the night, 7 hours before the takeoff of “Earth” now called “EARTH” (by logical reasons) 3 of our crews decided to explore the ocean of the planet. 3 hours after the takeoff, one of the crews came back to the base. Withdrawing a leg, his last seconds of life were on, his last words were, (in a low voice) “i was in the ocean, i saw things that no one wanted to see”. After that he died in front of us from hypothermia.</p>
